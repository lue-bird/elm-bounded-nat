# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to making participation a harassment-free experience for EVERYONE.

## Which means for example

* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* (accepting) constructive criticism
* avoiding behavior inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project and public spaces for representative individuals.

## Enforcement

Report unacceptable behavior by contacting indique.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
